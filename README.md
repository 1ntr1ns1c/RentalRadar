# RentalRadar üè†üì°

> A mobile-first, admin-controlled web platform for helping tenants discover vacant rental houses around them without walking door to door.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
**RentalRadar** is a responsive web application built to streamline the house-hunting process for local tenants. It allows tenants to browse listings, filter by location and room count, and send inquiries to caretakers or admins. The system is admin-controlled, meaning only verified users can create or manage listings.
